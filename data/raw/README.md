# Raw Data Files

This directory contains the raw spectral and chronoamperometry data files needed for the vibronic fitting analysis:

- `Buffer.txt`: Raw spectral data
- `Baseline_0.txt`: 0% transmission baseline
- `Baseline_100.txt`: 100% transmission baseline
- `CA.csv`: Chronoamperometry data (time, current, voltage)

These files are used as input for the main analysis script. Refer to the main README for more details on the data processing workflow.
